    <h2>DESCRIPTION OF THE RECIPE</h2>

    <p>This is by far one of the best recipes that I have created on my own which is serving me as my breakfast for the past 2 years. It is one of the most healthiest and protein-filled meals.</p>

    <p>This can be prepared in under 2 minutes, so a really good breakfast option when it comes to chaotic mornings. It can keep you full for about 5 hours as it is filled with fibre in the form of Oats!</p>

    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>ROLLED OATS (100 gms)</li>
        <li>2% REDUCED FAT MILK (500 mL)</li>
        <li>Honey (1 tbsp)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>STEPS TO PREPARE</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Take 100 gms of rolled oats and put in a blender and blend it for about 30 seconds, which turns the oats into a fine powder.</li>
        <li>Then measure 500 mL of the reduced fat milk and pour it into the blender in which you have the powdered oats already blended.</li>
        <li>Blend the mixture of powdered oats and the milk for 30 seconds as to make the shake more liquid in consistency and not really lumpy.</li>
        <li>Voila! Your high protein high fibre oats shake is ready to be served!</li>
    </ol>
