    <h2>DESCRIPTION OF THE RECIPE</h2>

    <p>This is by far one of the best recipes that I have created on my own which is serving me as my breakfast for the past 2 years. It is one of the most healthiest and protein-filled meals.</p>

    <p>This can be prepared in under 2 minutes, so a really good breakfast option when it comes to chaotic mornings. It can keep you full for about 5 hours as it is filled with fibre in the form of Oats!</p>
